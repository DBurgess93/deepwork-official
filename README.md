HOW TO CREATE A THEME

1. Navigate to creation.html.erb. This is the view that you will render your template partial in.
2. Add the path /builder to your url. This is your sandbox to see your changes as you go.
3. Create your html.erb partial file and the .scss partial file associated with it.
4. BUILD
  - Add the timer to it (More timers will be available soon)
  - Add Intention
  - Add Leave Button (you may have to convert to "root_path" while on builder page due to access issues with controller)
5. This theme will have to be added to the Seeds.rb file to use it.
6. Rails db:seed to now get access to it.
7. Repeat
